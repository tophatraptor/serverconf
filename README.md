###Server configuration log parsing

Lab assignment from cs162 - write a c program, along with a yacc/lex grammar to determine whether or not server configurations are valid.

Examples of good/bad server logs are in server.conf.good/server.conf.bad, respectively.

Files I wrote:
-configparse.c
-parse.y
-tokens.l
